The fisher is closely related to, but larger than, the Pacific marten. Fishers have few predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. An omnivore, it feeds on a wide variety of small animals and occasionally on fruits and mushrooms. It prefers the snowshoe hare and is one of the few animals able to prey successfully on porcupines. Male and female fishers look similar, but can be differentiated by size, with males being up to twice as large as the females. Males are 90–120 cm (35–47 in) in total length and weigh 3.5–6.0 kg (8–13 lb). Females measure 75–95 cm (30–37 in) and weigh 2.0–2.5 kg (4–6 lb).

Its primary prey consists of mice, rats, squirrels, chipmunks, shrews, moles and rabbits. The long-tailed weasel is one of the larger weasels (comprising both Neogale and Mustela) in North America. Unlike skunks, which spray their musk, the long-tailed weasel drags and rubs its body over surfaces in order to leave the scent, to mark their territory. There is substantial disagreement both on the upper end of their size and difference in size by sex by source: one indicates a body length of 300–350 mm (12–14 in) and a tail comprising 40–70% of the head and body length. It adds that in most populations, females are 10–15% smaller than males. The footprint of a long-tailed weasel is about 1 inch (25 mm) long.

After a fire wiped out the enclosure, they decided to let the animals roam the 80,000-acre estate. With selective harvests, these Sambar have lived there for the last 95 years. Populations have declined substantially due to severe hunting, local insurgency, and industrial exploitation of habitat.  In general, they attain a height of 102 to 160 cm (40 to 63 in) at the shoulder and may weigh as much as 546 kg (1,204 lb), though more typically 100 to 350 kg (220 to 770 lb). Among all living cervid species, only the moose and the elk can attain larger sizes. Adult males and pregnant or lactating females possess an unusual hairless, blood-red spot located about halfway down the underside of their throats. This sometimes oozes a white liquid, and is apparently glandular in nature. The males live alone for much of the year, and the females live in small herds of up to 16 individuals.

The ventral sides of the limbs are yellow. Male blue belly lizards also have blue patches on their throats. They can change color from light grey or tan to nearly jet black for the purpose of thermoregulation while basking. Studies have shown that cases of Lyme disease are rarer in areas where the lizards are found. When ticks carrying Lyme disease feed on these lizards' blood (which they commonly do, especially around their ears), a protein in the lizard's blood kills the bacterium in the tick that causes Lyme disease. The infection inside the ticks' gut is therefore cleared and the tick no longer carries Lyme disease.

The leaves are orbicular, 8–18 cm diameter, palmately lobed with five to nine lobes, and a coarsely serrated margin. The flowers are 3–4 cm diameter, dark pink to purple and grow in fasciculate axillary clusters of two to seven. Malva arborea tolerates sea water to varying degrees, at up to 100% sea water in its natural habitat, excreting salt through glands on its leaves. This salt tolerance can be a competitive advantage over inland plant species in coastal areas. Its level of salinity tolerance is thought to be improved by soil with higher phosphate content, making guano enrichment particularly beneficial. The leaves of the species are used in herbal medicine to treat sprains, by steeping them in hot water and applying the poultice to the affected area.[14] It is theorised that lighthouse keepers may have spread the plant to some British islands for use as a poultice and to treat burns, an occupational hazard.[15][16] Thought to have been used as an alternative to toilet paper.

By 1933, fewer than 70 wild individuals were known to exist; extinction seemed imminent until aerial surveys discovered a Pacific population of several thousand trumpeter swans around Alaska's Copper River. Careful reintroductions by wildlife agencies and the Trumpeter Swan Society gradually restored the North American wild population to over 46,000 birds by 2010. The mute swan, introduced to North America, is scarcely smaller. However, it can easily be distinguished by its orange bill and different physical structure (particularly the neck, which is typically held curved as opposed to straight in the trumpeter).

Mammal,Morro Bay Kangaroo Rat,Dipodomys heermanni morroensis,Rodentia,Heteromyidae,"The species is the smallest subspecies of the Heermann's kangaroo rat and is endemic to a restricted 2 km area south of Morro Bay in San Luis Obispo County, California. Like gerbils and pyramid rats, the Morro Bay kangaroo rats resemble little kangaroos, with well-developed hind limbs for jumping, short front limbs, and a long tail used for balance while leaping. Their ears are average in size and the hair on their backs varies between brown and yellow, while the hair on their bellies is white. As nocturnal animals, their eyes are very large. The Morro Bay kangaroo rat is 11 to 13 cm long and its tail measures between 16 and 19 cm. It weighs between 60 and 80 g. The primary food of Morro Bay kangaroo rats is seeds. As of 2023, despite numerous localized and range-wide surveys, the animal has not been detected by any of these analyses and has remained unseen since 1986.",Endangered,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSypxDpCC-6qn3VbPk58Zav5kg0FLuwmir9Ig&s,,,,,,,
Mammal,Desert bighorn sheep,Ovis canadensis californiana,Artiodactyla,Bovidae,"The Desert Mountain bighorn sheep is one of three subspecies of bighorn sheep. The bighorn sheep is one of only two species of sheep native to North America. It is found  in the intermountain west and southwestern regions, as well as northwestern Mexico.. The species range from 115 to 280 pounds (52 to 127 kg), while ewes are somewhat smaller. Both sexes develop horns soon after birth, with horn growth continuing more or less throughout life. Older rams have curling horns measuring over three feet long with more than one foot of circumference at the base. The ewes' horns are much smaller and lighter and do not tend to curl. After eight years of growth, the horns of an adult ram may weigh more than 30 pounds. They live 6-8 years and are a priority species in California. Bighorn sheep graze on grasses and browse shrubs, particularly in fall and winter, and seek minerals at natural salt licks. Desert bighorn sheep are social, forming herds of eight to 10 individuals; sometimes herds of 100 are observed. Bighorn sheep of all ages are threatened by black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, and especially mountain lions.

Mammal,Pacific Right Whale,Eubalaena japonica,Artiodactyla,Balaenidae,"The North Pacific right whale is a very large, thickset baleen whale species that is extremely rare and endangered. The Northeast Pacific population, which summers in the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 30-40 animals. The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth. E. japonica is easily distinguished from other North Pacific whale species by several fieldmarks: lack of dorsal fin or bump, very broad, black back, cyamid-covered callosities on the head and lips, a very arched jaw line, a very narrow rostrum, and often a V-shaped spout. North Pacific right whales can reach 15 to 18.3 m (49 to 60 ft) in length as adults, larger than the North Atlantic right whale. Typical body mass is from 50,000–80,000 kg (110,000–180,000 lb), or to 100,000 kg (220,000 lb) which weighs twice as of typical humpback whales. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. They can live to be 70 years old. They give birth to one calf every 3-5 years. Like right whales in other oceans, North Pacific right whales feed primarily on copepods. The North Pacific right whale feeds by skimming water continuously while swimming. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead, they have very large heads and mouths that allow them to swim with their mouths open (similar to the basking and whale sharks); the water with the copepods flows in, then flows sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips. Right whales are also unique in that they all have callosities—roughened patches of epidermis covered with thousands of small light-colored cyamids.",Endangered,https://thewhaletrail.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1280_UApR6adyss92.jpg,https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/s3//styles/original/s3/2023-11/750x500-B2A-3505-19Sept2023.jpg?itok=dKSpgxhV,,,,,,
Mammal,Guadalupe Fur Seal,Arctocephalus townsendi,Carnivora,Otariidae,"The Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi) is one of eight members of the fur seal genus Arctocephalus. They are the northernmost member of this genus. Sealers reduced the population to just a few dozen by the late 19th century, but the species had recovered to 10,000 in number by the late 1990s.  In 2013, the population of Guadalupe fur seals was estimated to be between 34,000 and 44,000, around one-fifth of the estimated historical population size. Many individuals can be found on Mexico's Guadalupe Island. Adult Guadalupe fur seals are dark brown or dusty gray with yellowish silver manes, called guard hairs, on the back of the neck. Males can grow to about seven feet in length and weigh upwards of 400 pounds, while females are typically only five feet long and weigh about 110 pounds. Additionally, males usually have a larger head and are lighter brown in color. Both males and females have a twenty-year lifespan. Guadalupe fur seals have distinctive ear flaps and large flippers for walking on land, confirming that they are not phocids (true seals) but are more closely related to sea lions. Guadalupe fur seal pups are born with black coats similar to those of adult Guadalupe fur seals, but it is difficult to distinguish juvenile Guadalupe fur seals from juveniles of California sea lions and Northern fur seals due to physiological similarities. Guadalupe fur seals commonly hunt in shallow water (maximum depth of 250 feet/76 meters) and catch squid, mackerels, and lanternfish. They feed exclusively at night. The IUCN designates them as a species of least concern. California lists the species as threatened and protected.",Threatened,https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/storage/app/uploads/public/70a/26b/aa0/thumb__2400_0_0_0_auto.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Arctocephalus_townsendi.jpg,,,,,,
Mammal,Salt-Marsh Harvest Mouse,Reithrodontomys raviventris,Rodentia,Cricetidae,"The salt-marsh harvest mouse, also known as the red-bellied harvest mouse, is an endangered rodent endemic to the San Francisco Bay Area salt marshes in California. It is protected by the state. The endangered designation of the salt-marsh harvest mouse is due to its limited range, historic decline in population and continuing threat of habitat loss due to development encroachment on the perimeter of the San Francisco Bay. The northern subspecies (R. r. halicoetes) is lighter in color and inhabits the northern marshes of the bay, and the southern subspecies (R. r. raviventris) lives in the East and South Bay marshes. In both subspecies the tail is likewise bicolored. An adult's length is 5–7 centimetres (2.0–2.8 in) and a tail length of 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in). Its height is between 1.5 and 2.1 centimetres (0.59 and 0.83 in). The weight of a mature mouse is about 10–20 grams (0.35–0.71 oz). This species is nocturnal. It occupies marsh habitats where pickleweed and marsh plants abound. Its many predators include hawk, snake and owl species, as well as shorebirds and larger mammals. Survey data from Suisun Marsh found that the salt-marsh harvest mouse can live up to 18 months and possibly longer. Females commonly have two litters per year.

Mammal,North American Wolverine,Gulo gulo luscus,Carnivora,Mustelidae,"The wolverine is the largest terrestrial member of the family Mustelidae, with adult males weighing 12 to 18 kilograms (kg) (26 to 40 pounds (lb)) and adult females weighing 8 to 12 kg (17 to 26 lb). It resembles a small bear with a bushy tail. It has a round, broad head; short, rounded ears; and small eyes. There are five toes on each foot, with curved and semiretractile claws used for digging and climbing. California lists the species as threatened and protected. The North American wolverine is one of two subspecies of wolverine. The wolverine has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself. Wolverines have thick, dark, oily fur which is highly hydrophobic, making it resistant to frost. This has led to its traditional popularity among hunters and trappers as a lining in jackets and parkas in Arctic conditions. Wolverines are primarily scavenger. Most of their food is carrion, especially in winter and early spring. They may find carrion themselves, feed on it after the predator (often, a wolf pack) has finished, or simply take it from another predator. Wolverines are known to follow wolf and lynx trails to scavenge the remains of their kills. Successful males will form lifetime relationships with two or three females, which they will visit occasionally, while other males are left without a mate. The average lifespan is between 8 and 10 years. The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range.",Threatened,https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/styles/scale_width_480/public/2022-03/wolverine-nps.jpg?itok=ukawRQ8K,,,,,,,
Mammal,Southern Sea Otter,Enhydra lutris nereis,Carnivora,Mustelidae,"Southern sea otters are one of three subspecies of sea otter and are found along the Central California coast, specifically from San Mateo County in the north to Santa Barbara County in the south, including San Nicolas Island. Southern sea otters have longer rostrums and smaller teeth than the other subspecies. They inhabit coastal marine areas, including rocky and sandy areas along the exposed outer coast, and bays and estuaries. California lists the species as threatened and protected. The southern sea otter is endangered due to a combination of factors, including oil spills, reduced habitat, and vulnerability to disease. Historically, fur hunting decimated their population, and although they have rebounded, they remain threatened by environmental factors like pollution and habitat degradation. The sea otter is one of the smallest marine mammal species, but it is the heaviest mustelid. Male sea otters usually weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb) and are 1.2 to 1.5 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in) in length, though specimens up to 54 kg (119 lb) have been recorded. Females are smaller, weighing 14 to 33 kg (31 to 73 lb) and measuring 1.0 to 1.4 m (3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 7 in) in length. Unlike most other marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its exceptionally thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 strands of hair per square centimetre (970,000/in2), its fur is the densest of any animal. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various mollusks and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. Its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times greater than that of similar-sized land mammals–and the air trapped in its fur. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with lifespans ranging from 10 to 15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. The leading mammalian predators of this species is the orca. Sea lions and bald eagles may prey on pups.",Threatened,https://www.aquariumofpacific.org/images/made_new/images-uploads-21_Southern_Sea_Otter_-_Robin_Riggs_600_q85.jpg,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64bf258d95411946cad7f39e/64da36390a55d235fe8e3f01/64da364330ef1e451ea71a87/1732057941377/PC200982.JPG?format=1500w,,,,,,
