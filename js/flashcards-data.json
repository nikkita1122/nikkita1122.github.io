The American Ornithologists' Union split the plain titmouse into the oak titmouse and the juniper titmouse in 1996, due to distinct differences in song, preferred habitat, and genetic makeup. Interestingly, the male titmouse has a repertoire upwards of 12 calls or songs.",

Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Most breeding activities take place in the spring; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Females lay up to four eggs, and then incubate them for six weeks. The golden eagle is part of a broad group of raptors called \"booted eagles\" which are defined by the feature that all species have feathering over their tarsus.",

The Buena Vista Lake ornate shrew requires dense groundcover, to protect it from predators, and moist soil that supports diverse prey populations of insects, earthworms and other small invertebrates. The Buena Vista Lake ornate shrew was listed as endangered in March 2002.",

Coloration is usually black, sometimes metallic. S. o. sinuosus has an elongated skull shape, that is relatively narrow and fragile. A lifespan of 16 months is considered to apply to most shrew taxa, with females surviving slightly longer than males. During winter, most shrews undergo a dramatic decrease in body mass, and second-year individuals typically die then. The skull, kidneys, and some other internal organs are actually reduced in size so as to require less nutrition intake for survival.",

The animal's feet prevent it from sinking into the snow when it hops and walks. For camouflage, its fur turns white during the winter and rusty brown during the summer. Its flanks are white year-round. The snowshoe hare is also distinguishable by the black tufts of fur on the edge of its ears. Its ears are shorter than those of most other hares. This animal is mainly active at night and does not hibernate. A major predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx. Female snowshoe hares can become pregnant anytime after the 35th day of gestation. The second litter can therefore be conceived before the first litter is born (snowshoe hares have twin uteri).",

    "description": "The Pacific pocket mouse, Perognathus longimembris pacificus, is endemic to California. It lives in sandy coastal soils of the coastal sage scrub ecoregion. It eats seeds and some insects. It was believed to be extinct until 1993, when a small population was discovered. It is now a federally listed Endangered animal species. Most of the body is covered in fur that feels silky. The coats are spineless and bristle free. The color of the Pacific pocket mouse is linked to the environment they live in, hence they are the color of the soil. The dorsal side of the pocket mouse is usually brown and pinkish while the ventral is usually white. There are typically two patches of hair that are lighter at the base of the ear, a distinguishing mark of the Pacific pocket mouse. The tail can either be distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. They have not been recorded farther than 2.5 miles (4.0 km) away from the ocean. The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest mammal that hibernates. The Pacific pocket mouse is critical to its ecosystem because the mice disperse the seeds of native plants and their digging encourages plant growth. Individuals range from 4.25 inches (108 mm) to 5.2 inches (130 mm) in length from the nose to the tip of the tail which makes them amongst the smallest subspecies of pocket mice. The tail of the pocket mouse is 2.125 inches (54.0 mm). The height of the pocket mouse is .625 in (15.9 mm). They weigh usually from 0.25 to 0.33 oz (7.1 to 9.4 g), about three pennies! They live for 3-5 years. ",

The Channel Island skunk is one of two terrestrial carnivores on the islands, the other being the island fox.  It is distinguished from mainland spotted skunks by its shorter tail with less white ventral coloration (45% white compared to 55% white), slightly larger size, broader skull, and proportionately less white and more black in pelage color. They also tend to have smoother, glossier fur than the mainland variation. It can be identified by an arrangement of white stripes on black fur, running vertically down the back. There are 4 to 6 stripes and they are usually broken up to give the skunk its “spotted” appearance. The abdomen is white and there is also a small white triangle on the forehead.

Botta's pocket gopher is strictly herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter. Shoots and grasses are particularly important, supplemented by roots, tubers, and bulbs during the winter. An individual often pulls plants into the ground by the roots to consume them in the safety of its burrow, where it spends 90% of its life.

They are brown to black in color (the brown may be sandy or greenish) and have black stripes on their backs, but their most distinguishing characteristic is their bright blue bellies. The ventral sides of the limbs are yellow. Male blue belly lizards also have blue patches on their throats. They can change color from light grey or tan to nearly jet black for the purpose of thermoregulation while basking. Studies have shown that cases of Lyme disease are rarer in areas where the lizards are found. When ticks carrying Lyme disease feed on these lizards' blood (which they commonly do, especially around their ears), a protein in the lizard's blood kills the bacterium in the tick that causes Lyme disease. The infection inside the ticks' gut is therefore cleared and the tick no longer carries Lyme disease. They may perform \"push-up like motions\", which shows off their blue stomachs and acts as a warning for other animals to stay away from their territory. ",

    "description": "The tree mallow, is a species of mallow native to the coasts of western Europe and the Mediterranean region, from Ireland and Britain south to Algeria and Libya, and east to Greece. It is a shrubby annual, biennial or perennial plant growing to 0.5–2 m (rarely 3 m) tall. The leaves are orbicular, 8–18 cm diameter, palmately lobed with five to nine lobes, and a coarsely serrated margin. The flowers are 3–4 cm diameter, dark pink to purple and grow in fasciculate axillary clusters of two to seven. Malva arborea tolerates sea water to varying degrees, at up to 100% sea water in its natural habitat, excreting salt through glands on its leaves. This salt tolerance can be a competitive advantage over inland plant species in coastal areas. Its level of salinity tolerance is thought to be improved by soil with higher phosphate content, making guano enrichment particularly beneficial. The leaves of the species are used in herbal medicine to treat sprains, by steeping them in hot water and applying the poultice to the affected area.[14] It is theorised that lighthouse keepers may have spread the plant to some British islands for use as a poultice and to treat burns, an occupational hazard.[15][16] Thought to have been used as an alternative to toilet paper. The seeds are edible and are known in French as \"petit pains\", or \"little breads\".",

Brugmansia species are among the most toxic of ornamental plants. All seven species are known only in cultivation or as escapees from cultivation, and no wild plants have ever been confirmed. They are therefore listed as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List, although they are popular ornamental plants and still exist wild outside their native range as introduced species.[4] It is suspected that their extinction in the wild is due to the extinction of some animal which previously dispersed the seeds.",

It has a long, regenerative tail; long, powerful hind limbs; and a short, blunt snout. Adult males are slightly larger than females, ranging in size from 3.4 to 4.7 inches (86 to 119 mm) in length, excluding tail. Females are 3.4 to 4.4 inches (86 to 112 mm). Males weigh 1.3 to 1.5 ounces (37 to 43 g), females 0.8 to 1.2 ounces (23 to 34 g). The background color ranges from yellowish or light gray-brown to dark brown, depending on the surrounding soil color and vegetation. The underside is uniformly white. It has rows of dark spots across the back, alternating with white, cream-colored or yellow bands. Also, unlike almost all other crotaphytids, juvenile G. sila obtain a yellow coloring under the hind limbs and tails. The signs of yellow coloration in young G. sila might indicate that some type of signal is being sent to adult leopard lizards, although no testing has been done. Possibly the purpose of yellow coloration is to signal to adults that carriers are too small to breed, and, therefore, do not pose a competitive threat.",

By 1933, fewer than 70 wild individuals were known to exist; extinction seemed imminent until aerial surveys discovered a Pacific population of several thousand trumpeter swans around Alaska's Copper River. Careful reintroductions by wildlife agencies and the Trumpeter Swan Society gradually restored the North American wild population to over 46,000 birds by 2010. The mute swan, introduced to North America, is scarcely smaller. However, it can easily be distinguished by its orange bill and different physical structure (particularly the neck, which is typically held curved as opposed to straight in the trumpeter).  Like other swans, trumpeter swans often mate for life, and both parents participate in raising their young, but primarily the female incubates the eggs. Most pair bonds are formed when swans are 5 to 7 years old, although some pairs do not form until they are nearly 20 years old.",

The light-footed Ridgway's rail is a hen-sized marsh bird that is long-legged, long-toed, and approximately 14 inches long. It has a slightly down-curved beak and a short, upturned tail. Males and females are identical in plumage. Their cinnamon breast contrasts with the streaked plumage of the grayish brown back and gray and white barred flanks. The light-footed Ridgway's rail uses southern California coastal salt marshes, lagoons, and their maritime environs. The birds nest in the lower littoral zone of coastal salt marshes where dense stands of cordgrass are present. Found in coastal salt marshes and lagoons from southern Ventura County, California, southward to northern Baja California, Mexico. They look similar to the California Ridgway rail but they have a slightly more reddish-brown nape. Their feet are light gray or whitish.",

Both sexes develop horns soon after birth, with horn growth continuing more or less throughout life. Older rams have curling horns measuring over three feet long with more than one foot of circumference at the base. The ewes' horns are much smaller and lighter and do not tend to curl. After eight years of growth, the horns of an adult ram may weigh more than 30 pounds. They live 6-8 years and are a priority species in California. Bighorn sheep graze on grasses and browse shrubs, particularly in fall and winter, and seek minerals at natural salt licks. Desert bighorn sheep are social, forming herds of eight to 10 individuals; sometimes herds of 100 are observed. Bighorn sheep of all ages are threatened by black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, and especially mountain lions. It is listed as endangered and fully protected in the state of california.",

    "description": "The North Pacific right whale is a very large, thickset baleen whale species that is extremely rare and endangered. The Northeast Pacific population, which summers in the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 30-40 animals. The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth. E. japonica is easily distinguished from other North Pacific whale species by several fieldmarks: lack of dorsal fin or bump, very broad, black back, cyamid-covered callosities on the head and lips, a very arched jaw line, a very narrow rostrum, and often a V-shaped spout. North Pacific right whales can reach 15 to 18.3 m (49 to 60 ft) in length as adults, larger than the North Atlantic right whale. Typical body mass is from 50,000–80,000 kg (110,000–180,000 lb), or to 100,000 kg (220,000 lb) which weighs twice as of typical humpback whales. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. They can live to be 70 years old. They give birth to one calf every 3-5 years. Like right whales in other oceans, North Pacific right whales feed primarily on copepods. The North Pacific right whale feeds by skimming water continuously while swimming. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead, they have very large heads and mouths that allow them to swim with their mouths open (similar to the basking and whale sharks); the water with the copepods flows in, then flows sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips. Right whales are also unique in that they all have callosities—roughened patches of epidermis covered with thousands of small light-colored cyamids.",

    "description": "The Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi) is one of eight members of the fur seal genus Arctocephalus. They are the northernmost member of this genus. Sealers reduced the population to just a few dozen by the late 19th century, but the species had recovered to 10,000 in number by the late 1990s.  In 2013, the population of Guadalupe fur seals was estimated to be between 34,000 and 44,000, around one-fifth of the estimated historical population size. Many individuals can be found on Mexico's Guadalupe Island. Adult Guadalupe fur seals are dark brown or dusty gray with yellowish silver manes, called guard hairs, on the back of the neck. Males can grow to about seven feet in length and weigh upwards of 400 pounds, while females are typically only five feet long and weigh about 110 pounds. Additionally, males usually have a larger head and are lighter brown in color. Both males and females have a twenty-year lifespan. Guadalupe fur seals have distinctive ear flaps and large flippers for walking on land, confirming that they are not phocids (true seals) but are more closely related to sea lions. Guadalupe fur seal pups are born with black coats similar to those of adult Guadalupe fur seals, but it is difficult to distinguish juvenile Guadalupe fur seals from juveniles of California sea lions and Northern fur seals due to physiological similarities. Guadalupe fur seals commonly hunt in shallow water (maximum depth of 250 feet/76 meters) and catch squid, mackerels, and lanternfish. They feed exclusively at night. The IUCN designates them as a species of least concern. California lists the species as threatened and protected.",

    "description": "The salt-marsh harvest mouse, also known as the red-bellied harvest mouse, is an endangered rodent endemic to the San Francisco Bay Area salt marshes in California. It is protected by the state. The endangered designation of the salt-marsh harvest mouse is due to its limited range, historic decline in population and continuing threat of habitat loss due to development encroachment on the perimeter of the San Francisco Bay. The northern subspecies (R. r. halicoetes) is lighter in color and inhabits the northern marshes of the bay, and the southern subspecies (R. r. raviventris) lives in the East and South Bay marshes. In both subspecies the tail is likewise bicolored. An adult's length is 5–7 centimetres (2.0–2.8 in) and a tail length of 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in). Its height is between 1.5 and 2.1 centimetres (0.59 and 0.83 in). The weight of a mature mouse is about 10–20 grams (0.35–0.71 oz). This species is nocturnal. It occupies marsh habitats where pickleweed and marsh plants abound. Its many predators include hawk, snake and owl species, as well as shorebirds and larger mammals. Survey data from Suisun Marsh found that the salt-marsh harvest mouse can live up to 18 months and possibly longer. Females commonly have two litters per year. ",

    "description": "The wolverine is the largest terrestrial member of the family Mustelidae, with adult males weighing 12 to 18 kilograms (kg) (26 to 40 pounds (lb)) and adult females weighing 8 to 12 kg (17 to 26 lb). It resembles a small bear with a bushy tail. It has a round, broad head; short, rounded ears; and small eyes. There are five toes on each foot, with curved and semiretractile claws used for digging and climbing. California lists the species as threatened and protected. The North American wolverine is one of two subspecies of wolverine. The wolverine has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself. Wolverines have thick, dark, oily fur which is highly hydrophobic, making it resistant to frost. This has led to its traditional popularity among hunters and trappers as a lining in jackets and parkas in Arctic conditions. Wolverines are primarily scavenger. Most of their food is carrion, especially in winter and early spring. They may find carrion themselves, feed on it after the predator (often, a wolf pack) has finished, or simply take it from another predator. Wolverines are known to follow wolf and lynx trails to scavenge the remains of their kills. Successful males will form lifetime relationships with two or three females, which they will visit occasionally, while other males are left without a mate. The average lifespan is between 8 and 10 years. The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range.",

    "family": "Mustelidae",
    "description": "Southern sea otters are one of three subspecies of sea otter and are found along the Central California coast, specifically from San Mateo County in the north to Santa Barbara County in the south, including San Nicolas Island. Southern sea otters have longer rostrums and smaller teeth than the other subspecies. They inhabit coastal marine areas, including rocky and sandy areas along the exposed outer coast, and bays and estuaries. California lists the species as threatened and protected. The southern sea otter is endangered due to a combination of factors, including oil spills, reduced habitat, and vulnerability to disease. Historically, fur hunting decimated their population, and although they have rebounded, they remain threatened by environmental factors like pollution and habitat degradation. The sea otter is one of the smallest marine mammal species, but it is the heaviest mustelid. Male sea otters usually weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb) and are 1.2 to 1.5 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in) in length, though specimens up to 54 kg (119 lb) have been recorded. Females are smaller, weighing 14 to 33 kg (31 to 73 lb) and measuring 1.0 to 1.4 m (3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 7 in) in length. Unlike most other marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its exceptionally thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 strands of hair per square centimetre (970,000/in2), its fur is the densest of any animal. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various mollusks and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. Its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times greater than that of similar-sized land mammals–and the air trapped in its fur. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with lifespans ranging from 10 to 15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. The leading mammalian predators of this species is the orca. Sea lions and bald eagles may prey on pups.",
